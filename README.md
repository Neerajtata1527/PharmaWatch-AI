# 💊 PharmaWatch AI
### Multi-Agent AI Platform for Predicting Drug Shortages & Strengthening Healthcare Supply Chains



**Predict. Analyze. Prepare.**

*Turning global healthcare intelligence into proactive decisions.*

</p>

---

# 📖 Overview

Medicine shortages continue to disrupt healthcare systems across the world. Hospitals often become aware of shortages only after inventories reach critically low levels, leaving little time to respond.

**PharmaWatch AI** is an AI-powered healthcare supply chain intelligence platform designed to predict potential medicine shortages before they become critical.

Unlike traditional monitoring systems that rely only on historical inventory data, PharmaWatch AI continuously gathers information from global events, pharmaceutical research, and healthcare intelligence using multiple AI agents. The platform analyzes these signals to estimate supply risks, identify vulnerable medicines, simulate disruption scenarios, and recommend therapeutic alternatives.

By combining Large Language Models (LLMs), Multi-Agent AI, structured data validation, and interactive visualizations, PharmaWatch AI enables healthcare organizations to move from reactive crisis management to proactive decision-making.

# 🚨 Problem Statement

Healthcare supply chains are becoming increasingly vulnerable due to:

- Natural disasters
- Geopolitical conflicts
- Manufacturing delays
- API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) shortages
- Transportation disruptions
- Disease outbreaks
- Regulatory restrictions
- Sudden demand surges

Most hospitals and healthcare providers identify shortages only after inventories become critically low.

The absence of an intelligent early-warning system results in:

- Delayed patient treatments
- Increased operational costs
- Emergency procurement
- Resource mismanagement
- Reduced healthcare resilience

---

# 💡 Our Solution

PharmaWatch AI introduces an AI-driven decision support system capable of continuously monitoring healthcare intelligence and predicting medicine shortages before they impact patient care.

The platform combines multiple specialized AI agents that collaborate to:

- Monitor global healthcare events
- Analyze pharmaceutical research
- Evaluate supply chain risks
- Predict medicine shortages
- Simulate disruption scenarios
- Recommend alternative medicines
- Present insights through interactive dashboards

Instead of simply reporting shortages, PharmaWatch AI explains *why* they may occur and helps decision-makers prepare accordingly.
